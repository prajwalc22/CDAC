Data structures are like containers that help us organize and 
store data in our computer programs. Just like you have different
containers for different things (a toy box for toys, a bookshelf for books),
we have different data structures for different types of data organization needs.


1. Structures in C
What is a Structure?

A structure is like a form or a template that groups related information together. Think of it like a student ID card that has name, age, and roll number all in one place.
Real-Life Example

Imagine you're the class monitor and need to keep track of students. Instead of having separate lists for names, ages, and roll numbers, you create a student record that has all information together.
Simple Structure Code

c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

// Creating a structure template
struct Student {
    char name[50];
    int age;
    int rollNumber;
    float marks;
};

int main() {
    // Creating a student record
    struct Student student1;
    
    // Filling the information
    strcpy(student1.name, "Alice");
    student1.age = 20;
    student1.rollNumber = 101;
    student1.marks = 85.5;
    
    // Printing the information
    printf("Student Information:\n");
    printf("Name: %s\n", student1.name);
    printf("Age: %d\n", student1.age);
    printf("Roll Number: %d\n", student1.rollNumber);
    printf("Marks: %.1f\n", student1.marks);
    
    return 0;
}
