Why we need the newNode pointer

Think of it this way: you can't directly create or work with a Node - you can only work with its address (pointer).
The memory analogy

When you do malloc(), it's like:

    The computer finds an empty room (memory space) big enough for your Node

    But the computer doesn't give you the room itself - it gives you the room number (address)

    newNode is like a sticky note where you write down that room number

Why can't we just work directly with the Node?

In C, you cannot directly handle objects - you can only handle their addresses. It's like:

    You can't carry a house around - you can only carry the house address

    You can't pass an entire Node to functions - you can only pass where to find the Node

What the pointer actually does

The newNode pointer serves three crucial purposes:

    Navigation tool - It tells you where to find your Node in memory

Connection builder - You use it to link nodes together (newNode->next = someOtherNode)

Access method - You use it to read/write the Node's data (newNode->data = 5)
Simple analogy

Think of newNode as a GPS coordinate:

    The actual Node is like a house sitting somewhere in memory

    The pointer (newNode) is like the GPS coordinates that tell you exactly where that house is located

    You can't move the house, but you can share the coordinates with others

    When you want to visit the house (access the Node), you follow the coordinates

Why not just use the Node directly?

Because in C, Nodes don't have names - they only have locations. When malloc() creates a Node, it doesn't say "here's your Node called Bob" - it says "here's a Node at memory address 0x7fff2341".

The pointer is your only way to remember and use that address. Without it, your Node would be lost in memory - created but unreachable!
